# api-hack

Function:
  YouMove combines the user's caloric intake with their exercise output. By calculating the user's basal metabolic rate (BMR) and subtracting it from their daily caloric intake, a caloric deficit is produced and used to search the YouTube v3 Data API for workout videos. In the case that a user's caloric intake is lower than their BMR and their caloric deficit is a negative number, healthy recipe cooking videos are provided instead. If, or when, the videos do not suffice to provide challenge or interest, links to safe COVID-era activities at the bottom of the page are navigable. 
  Future enhancements may include a customized calorie counter, randomization or specification of workout types, and potential OAuth functionality that could unify the user's information with profile creation and data storage.
Technologies Used: HTML/CSS/JavaScript/jQuery
